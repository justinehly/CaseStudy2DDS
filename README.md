### ----- Executive Summary -----

This is a case study for DDSAnalytics that leverages data science for talent management. Talent management is the iterative process of developing and retaining employees and may include workforce planning, employee development through training and mentoring, increasing employee satisfaction and reducing voluntary employee attrition or churn.

The first part of this analysis focuses on attrition and utilizes a machine algorithm called Boruta to efficiently identify both statistically and highly probable statistically important factors that lead to attrition. After careful testing and modeling, it was determined that the three most influential factors contributing to attrition are overtime, monthly income and stock options.

The second part of this analysis focuses on job role trends. Based on the data, the employees seem to be on average all aobut the same when it comes to environment and job satisfaction, job involvement and work life balance with scores ranging from 2.5-3.0 on a 4 point scale. Sales Reps tend to be the youngest and have the lowest average scores in terms of satisfaction while managers tend to be the oldest and most satisfied with their jobs. Overall the company is very generous with annual pay raises with an overall average of 15.2%! 

Finally, we looked at estimating monthly salaries and determined the most influential factors are total working years, education level, job level and job role.
